										<h2 class="major">3. Coconut Oil</h2>
										<p>Time and time again coconut oils have been known to provide excellent benefits to your
											hair, health and body. The fatty acids in coconut oil can encourage your body to burn fat
											and are a great source of energy for your brain and body. They also raise HDL cholesterol
											In your blood which can help reduce risk of heart disease. Coconut oil shampoos on the
											other hand can help strengthen hair and nourish the scalp. I can personally recommend
											this product because it helped make my hair less brittle and healthier with a much softer
											touch.
